        <p>Coined by the American psychologist, B.F Skinner, Operant Conditioning considers the consequences of one's actions, whether they be positive or negative. The actions of rewarding or punishing are determined by the choices 
            made by the subject, which eventually influences them to continously make those good decisions which reap rewards. <br>
            Actions you the parent can take:,<br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; -Do not give anything to your child (unless it's a spanking) immediately after they've done wrong.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; -Encourage good behaviour by rewarding your child only after they've accomplished good, such as <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  successfully completing tasks, being nice to others, and showing proper manners.
