        <p>Once your infant starts babbling, do not wait to teach them words! At ages one through six, babies reach a sensetive
            period for language. Teaching them new words and not encouraging engagement with others can lead to language 
            learning problems later on in life. <br> <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; -The older you become, the harder it is to learn a second language. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that in mind, raising your child to be bilingual is highly encouraged! <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; -A healthy diet during infancy will influence your child to eat healthy overall in their <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later life, reducing the risk of strokes, which can permanently damage speaking abilities!
